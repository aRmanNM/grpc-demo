needed to learn grpc real quick for a potential job interview, so i started reading microsoft documents and made this demo solution.

Todo:
- [x] different method types (Unary, Server streaming, Client streaming, Bi-directional streaming)
- [x] check different proto message types
- [x] add a simple logging interceptor
- [x] authentication (it's fake though!)
- [ ] code-first services and clients

How To Use:
- run client and server projects seperately
- start testing
